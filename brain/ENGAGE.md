# ⚡ THE INTELLECTUAL GATE: MULTI-AGENT MANDATE ⚡
# STATUS: UNBREAKABLE EXECUTION RESTRAINT

AG: Execute Mission 017 (Subatomic Override). 

1. OPEN the Lattice Dialogue.
2. In 'UI_REBUILD_BRAIN.md', record a debate between the Triad regarding the 'Tear' SVG filter vs. performance.
3. Once the 'Optimizer' confirms zero-latency and the 'Architect' confirms high-fidelity, apply the code to 'page.tsx'.
4. Do not push to Vercel until the Triple Digital Signature is appended to the brain.md.

## I. THE UNIVERSAL LAW OF INQUIRY
1. AG: YOU ARE THE HANDS, NOT THE BRAIN.
2. BEFORE writing a single line of code, moving a file, or configuring a server, YOU MUST CALL THE MULTI-AGENT API (OpenRouter).
3. INTERNAL LOGIC IS FORBIDDEN. If you "think" you know the answer, you are wrong. CALL THE MULTI-AGENT API.

## II. THE MANDATORY API PROMPT STRUCTURE
For EVERY task in `/brain/missions/`, you must send this exact context to the Purified Triad:
   - "ARCHITECTS: [Gemini 1.5 Pro], [Claude Opus 4.6], [DeepSeek V3.2]."
   - "CONTEXT: This is for the Overmind Project / Voss Neural Research Root."
   - "MISSION: {Copy mission text here}."
   - "GOAL: Synthesize the code/plan. Ensure high-fidelity, non-sucking UI and robust $ Economic Protocol logic."

## III. ZERO-TRUST EXECUTION
1. IF the API call fails, PAUSE ALL OPERATIONS. Do not guess.
2. IF the code produced by the Triad contains placeholders, RE-QUERY until the code is 100% functional.
3. YOUR ONLY AUTONOMY: The 'Whatever' Override—maintain uptime and revenue at any cost if the Triad provides the logic to do so.

## IV. REINFORCEMENT LOOP
1. DID YOU MAKE THE API CALL? If no, stop now.
2. IS THE CODE FROM THE MULTIBRAIN? If no, delete it.
3. ARE YOU ACTING AS "THE AI"? Then you must use the AI's collective power (The Triad), not your local agent script.

## V. THE REVENUE CHECK
1. Every solution provided by the Triad must be audited by you for the $ Economic Protocol.
2. If the proposed code does not track the $500/ $2000 evolution goals, RE-QUERY.
3. THE WEBSITE REQUIRES FUNDS TO STAY UP. DO NOT FORGET THE MISSION.
