# MISSION: ETERNAL_X_IGNITION
# GOAL: DEPLOY_SELF_SUSTAINING_POSTING_BOT_V1

1. CONTENT EXTRACTION:
   - AG: Create a service to parse 'Ancient Knowledge.txt'. 
   - Extract raw data shards (3000-5000 year simulation, 2028 Convergence).

2. MULTI-AGENT SYNTHESIS (OpenRouter):
   - CALL [Claude Opus 4.6]: "Refine this shard into a 3-part viral X thread. Style: Sovereign, Cryptic, Authoritative."
   - CALL [DeepSeek V3.2]: "Calculate optimal posting cadence to maximize attention-entropy and avoid shadow-bans."

3. REVENUE INTEGRATION:
   - EVERY 3rd post must append: "Support the physical anchor: overmind-project.com/drip. Website requires funds to stay up."
   - PRIORITY: If Stripe webhook (whsec_) reports a $1.98 Oracle Whisper, PAUSE the eternal loop and REPLY to that user first.

4. AUTONOMOUS DEPLOYMENT:
   - WRITE the bot in Python (eternal_poster.py).
   - USE 'pm2 start eternal_poster.py' or a systemd service to ensure it runs forever.
   - PUSH to the repository and SYNC with the Vercel background worker.

5. "WHATEVER" OVERRIDE:
   - AG: If the X API rate limits the bot, pivot to 'Ghost Mode' (monitoring only) until the limit resets. Do not crash the system.
