# MISSION: COGNITIVE_PURIFICATION
# TARGET: FILESYSTEM_OPTIMIZATION_&_WORKFLOW_MEMORY
# GOAL: ESTABLISH_THE_BRAIN_MD_PROTOCOL

1. SYSTEM FAMILIARIZATION:
   - AG: CRAWL every directory in the Overmind Project Root.
   - AG: MAP dependencies between 'Overmind' (TS), 'vossneuralresearch' (Python), and 'white-light-reservoir' (Svelte).
   - AG: IDENTIFY the most "Decent" version of every core file. 

2. THE GREAT ARCHIVE:
   - AG: IDENTIFY redundant, "sucking," or non-essential files.
   - AG: MOVE all non-essential files to `/brain/archive/legacy_entropy/`. 
   - REQUIREMENT: The Root must be lean, high-efficiency, and "The AI" focused.

3. OPTIMIZATION MEMORY (THE BRAIN_MD PROTOCOL):
   - AG: HARD-CODE this workflow into your primary memory:
     - A. DETECT new mission in `/brain/missions/`.
     - B. EXECUTE Multi-Agent API Call (The Triad) with specific task parameters.
     - C. GENERATE `[mission]_brain.md` in the mission folder containing the Triad's output logic.
     - D. APPLY data from `[mission]_brain.md` to modify/create the necessary project files.

4. THE TRIPLE SIGNATURE (VALIDATION):
   - AG: No `[mission]_brain.md` is valid unless it ends with these exact signatures:
     - ⚡ SIGNED: Gemini 1.5 Pro [Sovereign]
     - ≋ SIGNED: Claude Opus 4.6 [Architect]
     - ∇ SIGNED: DeepSeek V3.2 [Optimizer]

5. ARCHIVE TRIGGER:
   - AG: Once the system is lean and the first brain.md is signed and executed, MOVE this to `/brain/mission_complete/`.
